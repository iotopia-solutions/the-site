    description: "Dog Watch manufactures hidden electronic pet fences that keep pets safe. We helped them develop an intelligent collar that combines both hidden fence and activity measuring capabilities so owners can keep their pets safe while ensuring they get enough exercise. The collar allows pets to play securely in their own yard while owners track their activities from either a web site or a dedicated mobile app. The collar is an unusual mix of active radio transmitters that communicate with a local portal connected to the user’s home network via WiFi or Ethernet. The portal communicates directly with a cloud service that converts raw data to JSON messages. It passes these messages to a web server, which serves both the web site and the app. With our expertise in IoT, we developed the portal and the cloud-based system. The portal runs on Raspberry Pi and the cloud system runs on Amazon’s Web Services. Both are Python based."

    description: "Agriculture has become an increasingly data-driven industry.  Machinery vendors have added big-data capabilities to their products but walled them off from farmers. Farmobile allows farmers to access, control and monetize the agronomic data captured by the machinery they use. We developed Farmobile’s “PUC” (Passive Uplink Connection), an IoT device that plugs into the data bus of agricultural equipment. The PUC records and transmits the time, position and other relevant agricultural information generated when cultivating a field. It can be used in devices located anywhere and remotely managed, and has store-and-forward capability when it can’t find a cellular or wifi connection. It’s transparent to the machinery that it’s connected to and only captures data. We provided software and hardware development for Farmobile and trained their staff so that when the PUC entered production they were able to take ownership of software development."

    description: "Electronic lab books have become a key tool used by drug companies in their development process. Perkin Elmer hired us to evaluate and update their Elements Electronic Lab Notebook, which stores information on chemistry, images and revision history. They had recently purchased a cloud-based application, which was experiencing performance issues, from a small startup. The application’s development cycle was costly because of an old and unsupported technology stack. We evaluated it from front end to back, including all of its ancillary applications and libraries and made numerous recommendations for improvements. The roadmap we developed became a guide for future revisions."

    description: "Big data helps deliver the best healthcare to patients. Humedica’s Optum One is a healthcare analytics system that allows medical researchers to query large data sets and produce tables, charts and other types of data visualization. We created a proof of concept for the migration of Optum One from Adobe Flex to JavaScript. After evaluating the current state of the application, we developed a roadmap for the implementation of JavaScript and our POC became the template for future development of the legacy application."
